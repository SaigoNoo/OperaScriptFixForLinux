# OperaScriptFixForLinux
OperaScriptFixForLinux is a small script for fixing failed video loadings like Instagram, x.com, facebook, etc... 

I don't know if it happen also on another distributions like Arch Linux, or any other, but what I wrote in the shell script helped me to solve the problem !

# How to do:
I guess you already have git as requirement in your computer !
```sh
git clone https://github.com/SaigoNoo/OperaScriptFixForLinux
cd OperaScriptFixForLinux
bash fix-opera.sh
```

# About versions
Fixing Opera fails was resolved with the **0.91.0** version I found on this [release repo](https://github.com/nwjs-ffmpeg-prebuilt/nwjs-ffmpeg-prebuilt/releases).
If you need an another version, just write n while it will be asked and write the version you need !

Nothing more are need !
